        	<h3>Timeline of Al-Mutanabbi:</h3>
        	<li><strong>915 </strong>Born in the Iraqi city of Kufah.</li>
            <li><strong>924 </strong>When Shi'ite Qarmatians sacked Kufah, he joined them and lived among the Bedouin.</li>
            <li><strong>932 </strong>He led a Qarmatian revolt in Syria.</li>
            <li><strong>935 </strong>He became a wandering poet, and during this period he began to write his first known poems.</li>
        	<li><strong>948 </strong>He attached himself to Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid poet-prince of northern Syria. Al-Mutanabbi joined the court of Sayf al-Dawla in this year.</li>
        	<li><strong>960 </strong>Al-Mutanabbi joined the court of Abu al-Misk Kafur after parting ways with Saif al Dawla, but Kafur dismissed Al-Mutanabbi's intentions claiming them to be a threat to his position. Al-Mutanabbi realized that his hopes of becoming a statesman were not going to be materialized and he left Egypt.</li>
            <li><strong>965 </strong>Al-Mutanabbi was killed because one of his poems contained a great insult to a man called "Dabbah al-Asadi". Dabbah, along with his uncle Fatik al-Asadi, managed to intercept al-Mutanabbi, his son Muhassad, and his servant near Baghdad.When al-Mutanabbi wished to flee, his servant awkwardly reminded him of his bold verses. For this reason, al-Mutanabbi resolved to live up to them, fought, and died along with his companions.</li>
